# Glow-Air-Hockey-Project

Our game is a computerized take on the table game air hockey.
To play the game input player names and desired colours into the console. A game window will appear and the players can move their paddles with the WASD (player one, bottom) and with the arrow keys (player two, top). The game can be paused at any time with the P key. When a player reaches a score of seven a game over message will be displayed, after a few seconds a button with the option to play again will be dislpayed. 

To run the application, download the and run the jar file "Glow Air Hockey Demo 3 G-05".

There is a JUnit test for the Puck class (puckTest.java). Run using JUnit 4.
