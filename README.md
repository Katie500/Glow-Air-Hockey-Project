# Glow-Air-Hockey-Project

Our game is a computerized take on the table game air hockey.
To play the game input player names and desired colours into the console. A game window will appear and the players can move their paddles with the WASD (player one, bottom) and with the arrow keys (player two, top). The game can be paused at any time with the P key. When a player reaches a score of seven a game over message will be displayed, closing the window and running the program again will begin a new game. 

To run the code for Demo 3, download the zip folder of the files from Github.
The main game function is GlowAirHockeyApp.java, run this file as a java application. You will then be prompted to input player and colour info into the console. From here you can view the current physics of the game. 

There is a JUnit test for the Puck class (puckTest.java). Run using JUnit 4.
