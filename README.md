# Glow-Air-Hockey-Project

Our game is a computerized take on the table game air hockey.

To run the code for demo 1, download the zip folder of the files.
The main game function is GlowAirHockeyApp.java

As of now, the program will ask for player names, paddle
colours and puck colour. The puck is given an initial velocity and
will randomly bounce around until a player wins by reaching 7 goals
by chance.
