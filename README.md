# Glow-Air-Hockey-Project

Our game is a computerized take on the table game air hockey.

To run the code for Demo 2, download the zip folder of the files from Github.
The main game function is GlowAirHockeyApp.java, run this file as a java application. You will then be prompted to input player and colour info into the console. From here you can view the current physics of the game. 

There is a working JUnit test for the Puck class. Run using JUnit 4.

As of now, the puck is given an initial velocity and will randomly bounce around until a player wins by reaching 7 goals by chance.
Friction, and puck collisions with the edges of the game board are working however collisions with the paddles are still a work in progress. 
We currently have a working GUI implimented using JavaFX, but paddle controls are yet to be implimented.
