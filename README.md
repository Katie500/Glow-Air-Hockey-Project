# Glow-Air-Hockey-Project

Our game is a computerized take on the table game air hockey.
To play the game input player names and desired colours into the console. A game window will appear and the players can move their paddles with the WASD (player one, bottom) and with the arrow keys (player two, top). The game can be paused at any time with the P key. When a player reaches a score of seven a game over message will be displayed, to play the game again click the button displayed and launch the program again.

To run the application, download and run the submitted jar file "Glow Air Hockey".
Alternatively, download a zipped file from github of Katie500/Glow-Air-Hockey-Project/Score-Attempt-2.
Import these files into an eclipse project. Ensure that the classes {Controller, Main, Player, Puck, puckTest, Table} are in a package named "application". Furthermore ensure that the classes {GameScreen, Menu, Rink} are in a package named "gui".

There is a JUnit test for the Puck class (puckTest.java). Run using JUnit 4.
